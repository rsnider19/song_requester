# 06 — Performer Home Screen

## Overview
The landing screen when a confirmed performer is in Performer mode. Focused on managing their own gigs.

## Layout
- List of all their upcoming gigs
- Floating action button (FAB) to add a new gig

## Gig list items
- Same format as the audience home screen gig cards (performer name, venue, date, start/end time)
- Tapping a gig navigates to the gig screen

## Open questions
- Should past gigs be accessible from this screen? (e.g. a "past gigs" tab or section)
- What does the empty state look like (no upcoming gigs)?
- Should the FAB navigate to the Add Gig screen or open a bottom sheet?
